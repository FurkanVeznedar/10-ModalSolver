# Modal Solver Development

## Project Name
Modal Solver Development

## Technologies
- C++
- OpenGL
- Eigen Library

## Description
In this project, I developed a modal solver for use in vibration analysis.

## Purpose
To calculate the vibration modes and natural frequencies of a given structure.

## Details
- **OpenGL** was used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) and visualize the results.
- **Eigen** library was utilized for matrix operations and linear algebra computations.
- Various vibration modes and natural frequencies were accurately determined.

## Results
- By the end of the project, it became possible to obtain both visual and numerical results for the vibration analysis of structures.
- Performance optimizations resulted in a %X improvement in computation times.
- The project can be used as a general solution method for similar problems.
